## To compile code
All code must be compiled before you can run it.  To compile means that you are converting your C++ code into a language that the computer can understand (e.g., binary).  To compile C++ code, run the following command in a terminal:
```
g++ fileName.cpp -o outFileName
```
This tells the C++ compiler to compile your file named `fileName.cpp`, and output it (`-o`) as a file named `outFileName`.

## To run code
After you have compiled the code, run your output file by running
```
./outFileName
```

## Compile and Run Example
Suppose I have a file named `classwork.cpp`.  I compile and run the file by doing
```
g++ classwork.cpp -o output
./output
```

## MadLib
Create a MadLib.  You can find an example [here](https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/).  A MadLib is a story where you are asked to provide words, and the words are used to create a funny story.

Ask the user to input words, numbers, etc., and make a funny little story.  Starter code has been provided for you.
